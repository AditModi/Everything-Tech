Basic Questions

what does "package main" mean
when we see the word package in go, we can think of a package as being like a project or a workspace a package is a collections of common source code files so a package can have many related file inside of it each file ending with a file extension of a ".go"

the only requirement for every file inside of the package is at the very first line of each file must declare the package it belongs

Two types of packages:
    Executable
    Reusable

what does "import" mean
the "import" is used to call whatever statement that needs to be used by our package

import "fmt"

so saying import fmt specificly means give my package main access to all of the code and all the functionality that is contained inside of other package called fmt

fmt the name of the standard library package that is includes with the go programming language by default the fmt package is used to print out a lot of different information specificly to the terminal just give you a better sense of debugging and stuff like that


what is that "func" thing
func is a short of the function in golang

    func main(){
        // code
    }

1.func is a function keyword
2.main is a function name
3.() is a function arguments
4.{} this is a function body


First program
Our first program will print the string "hello world!"

To Run the code, on the your terminal enter
    go run main.go 

Sometimes weâ€™ll want to build our programs into binaries. We can do this using go build.
    go build main.go

We can then execute the built binary directly.
